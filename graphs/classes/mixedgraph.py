    """Base class for mixed-edge graphs.

    A mixed-edge graph stores nodes and different kinds of edges.
    The edges can represent non-directed (i.e. `Graph`), or 
    directed (i.e. `DiGraph`) edge connections among nodes.

    Nodes can be any nodes that can be represented in `Graph`,
    and `DiGraph`.

    Edges are represented as links between nodes with optional
    key/value attributes.

        The copy method by default returns an independent shallow copy

        container, that container is shared by the original an the copy.
        Use Python's `copy.deepcopy` for new containers.

        If `as_view` is True then a view is returned instead of a copy.

        Notes
        -----
        All copies reproduce the graph structure, but data attributes
        may be handled in different ways. There are four types of copies
        of a graph that people might want.

        Deepcopy -- A "deepcopy" copies the graph structure as well as
        all data attributes and any objects they might contain.
        The entire graph object is new so that changes in the copy
        do not affect the original object. (see Python's copy.deepcopy)

        Data Reference (Shallow) -- For a shallow copy the graph structure
        is copied but the edge, node and graph attribute dicts are
        references to those in the original graph. This saves
        time and memory but could cause confusion if you change an attribute
        in one graph and it changes the attribute in the other.
        NetworkX does not provide this level of shallow copy.

        Independent Shallow -- This copy creates new independent attribute
        dicts and then does a shallow copy of the attributes. That is, any
        attributes that are containers are shared between the new graph
        and the original. This is exactly what `dict.copy()` provides.
        You can obtain this style copy using:

            >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
            >>> H = G.copy()
            >>> H = G.copy(as_view=False)
            >>> H = nx.Graph(G)
            >>> H = G.__class__(G)

        Fresh Data -- For fresh data, the graph structure is copied while
        new empty data attribute dicts are created. The resulting graph
        is independent of the original and it has no edge, node or graph
        attributes. Fresh copies are not enabled. Instead use:

            >>> H = G.__class__()
            >>> H.add_nodes_from(G)
            >>> H.add_edges_from(G.edges)

        View -- Inspired by dict-views, graph-views act like read-only
        versions of the original graph, providing a copy of the original
        structure without requiring any memory for copying the information.

        and deep copies, https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html.

        Like dict.update, this method takes a graph as input, adding the
        graph's nodes and edges to this graph. It can also take two inputs:
        edges and nodes. Finally it can take either edges or nodes.
        To specify only nodes the keyword `nodes` must be used.

        The collections of edges and nodes are treated similarly to
        the add_edges_from/add_nodes_from methods. When iterated, they
        should yield 2-tuples (u, v) or 3-tuples (u, v, datadict).

        Parameters
        ----------
        edges : Graph object, collection of edges, or None
            The first parameter can be a graph or some edges. If it has
            attributes `nodes` and `edges`, then it is taken to be a
            Graph-like object and those attributes are used as collections
            of nodes and edges to be added to the graph.
            If the first parameter does not have those attributes, it is
            treated as a collection of edges and added to the graph.
            If the first argument is None, no edges are added.
        nodes : collection of nodes, or None
            The second parameter is treated as a collection of nodes
            to be added to the graph unless it is None.
            If `edges is None` and `nodes is None` an exception is raised.
            If the first parameter is a Graph, then `nodes` is ignored.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)

        The OutMultiEdgeView provides set-like operations on the edge-tuples
        as well as edge attribute lookup. When called, it also provides
        an EdgeDataView object which allows control of access to edge
        attributes (but does not provide set-like operations).
        Hence, ``G.edges[u, v, k]['color']`` provides the value of the color
        attribute for the edge from ``u`` to ``v`` with key ``k`` while
        ``for (u, v, k, c) in G.edges(data='color', default='red', keys=True):``
        iterates through all the edges yielding the color attribute with
        default `'red'` if no color attribute exists.

        Edges are returned as tuples with optional data and keys
        in the order (node, neighbor, key, data). If ``keys=True`` is not
        provided, the tuples will just be (node, neighbor, data), but
        multiple tuples with the same node and neighbor will be
        generated when multiple edges between two nodes exist.

        Parameters
        ----------
        nbunch : single node, container, or all nodes (default= all nodes)
            The view will only report edges from these nodes.
        data : string or bool, optional (default=False)
            The edge attribute returned in 3-tuple (u, v, ddict[data]).
            If True, return edge attribute dict in 3-tuple (u, v, ddict).
            If False, return 2-tuple (u, v).
        keys : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, return edge keys with each edge, creating (u, v, k,
            d) tuples when data is also requested (the default) and (u,
            v, k) tuples when data is not requested.
        default : value, optional (default=None)
            Value used for edges that don't have the requested attribute.
            Only relevant if data is not True or False.

        Returns
        -------
        edges : OutMultiEdgeView
            A view of edge attributes, usually it iterates over (u, v)
            (u, v, k) or (u, v, k, d) tuples of edges, but can also be
            used for attribute lookup as ``edges[u, v, k]['foo']``.

        Notes
        -----
        Nodes in nbunch that are not in the graph will be (quietly) ignored.
        For directed graphs this returns the out-edges.

        The graph, edge and node attributes are shared with the original graph.
        Changes to the graph structure is ruled out by the view, but changes
